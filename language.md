# Terminology and language

## An important note about terminology and language

The Wellcome Historical Medical Museum and Library index cards and registers were predominantly compiled between the 1890s and the 1970s. Much of the information recorded on the accession cards was copied verbatim from auction sales catalogues, which were notoriously inaccurate.



The museum and library records reflect the period and context in which they were written. The language used is frequently problematic and sensitive, and includes outdated ethnographic classification terminology. Some of the language used is racist, offensive, or distressing, and it is often applied to discriminate. The records include entries for human remains, and for items which are considered secret or sacred by some communities.



By transcribing these handwritten and typescript records we aim to facilitate research into the colonial origins of many of our collections items, and to expose the power dynamics at play behind their acquisition, use, and (in some cases) dispersal to other museums and libraries. And we seek to understand better the assumptions and cultural appropriations that were made in documenting, categorising, researching, and managing museum and library collections at Wellcome over the course of the long twentieth century. All of the transcribed information is presented here within this historical context; however, we also aim to apply the results of the transcription to improving our contemporary collections information practice, helping to identify and address sensitivities amongst our collections and to develop better practices for documenting, displaying and explaining their complex histories and contexts.
