# Importing itemisation batches

For the most part these are very straightforward, as you are simply new entries in the Visual Collections table, not having to overwrite placeholder records.&#x20;

1. Spot check to ensure the batch is not currently represented in the Visual Collections table.
2. Log in to TW as admin.
3. Import the spreadsheet using RecordID# as the merge field. You only need to import columns which have data in them - if they are entirely blank, click 'do not import' instead. The columns to import are generally:
   * Visual Accession Number Prefix&#x20;
   * CC number \[Visual Accession Number without prefix]
   * WA/HMM reference \[Register]
   * Image number
4. Spot check that links to digitised images are working correctly.
5. Move spreadsheet into 'Imported into QB' folders and mark import as complete in Transcribers spreadsheet.
