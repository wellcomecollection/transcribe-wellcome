# Standardising Library Accession Numbers on Sierra

As part of inventory, and to assist the work of Transcribe Wellcome, the team add accession numbers onto the Sierra item records. This data is then used to link records from the Transcribe Wellcome site to items on the Wellcome Collection site.&#x20;

At the beginning of the project, there was little to no standardisation of EPB accession data. In July 2023, to ease the linking process, the procedure was updated and existing data was prepared on spreadsheets for standardisation.&#x20;

There are 3 main data scenarios to cleanse:

1. Accession numbers in boundwiths which have numbers in brackets at the end (only occurred during the early part of inventory)
2. Items which appear to have multiple accession numbers
3. Indistinct or cropped accession numbers

**Scenario 1**

Simply remove the brackets from the end of the number on the Sierra item record e.g. 42550 (1) becomes 42550. No need to update the spreadsheet.

**Scenario 2**

Recheck the numbers rather than simply standardise. This can be done using the digitised version, when available, or looking at the physical book. If there are multiple accession numbers, separate them  in the accession number field with a semi colon e.g. 54800; 95400. No need to update the spreadsheet.

**Scenario 3**

Recheck the numbers rather than simply standardise. This can be done using the digitised version, when available, or looking at the physical book. If still indistinct, try searching for the title or number on the Transcribe Wellcome site. If you are able to find the full number, add it to the accession number field on Sierra. If the book is from one of the earlier registers, which do not regularly record accession numbers, but you are able to link it with a record on Transcribe Wellcome, add the TW record number to the 'TW Record' column on the spreadsheet. At the end of standardisation, the TW numbers will be collected together in a single spreadsheet as there may be a way to link the record on the Transcribe Wellcome site with the records on the Wellcome Collection site.

If you are unable to read the accession number or add it from the Transcribe Wellcome site, write what you can and add a question mark in square brackets at the end e.g. 7893\[?].
