# Checking & importing visual batches

## PHO Registers

* Unhide any hidden columns and delete them if they are blank to avoid confusion during the import stage
* Insert a new column for `PHO Prefix` (to the left of `PHO No.`) and fill down the column with the text 'PHO' in each cell
* Insert a new column for `RID#` (to the left of `Date of Accession`)
