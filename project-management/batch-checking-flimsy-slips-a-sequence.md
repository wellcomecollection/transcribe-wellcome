# Batch checking - Flimsy slips \(A sequence\)

> ## Step 1: Prepare your batch for checking

1. The file will be saved under the location Documents -&gt; General -&gt; **Completed spreadsheets** in the Teams group
2. Select the file and download it to _your_ local OneDrive. This is the file you will be working with to check - **not** the copy in the Teams folder.
3. Open the Transcribers Admin spreadsheet and locate this particular batch, enter the date when the "returned date" \(this date can be found in the 'modified' column in the Teams folder most of the time\)
4. Open a notepad file and keep this available to you for note taking for any feedback that you think is appropriate as you go through the batch
5. Remember to visually check the batch throughout your checking process in case there's anything outside of these steps that may need to be fixed

## Step 2: Check and prepare the sheet for import

1. Unhide any hidden columns. Delete column C if it is empty OR has links in it.
2. Insert a new column after 'R number' and title it 'R year number'.
3. Check if column B has any missing /  in the WA/HMM references.
4. Check if there are any empty cells in column B and make sure they are filled in with the correct WA/HMM reference.
5. Check to see if there are any empty rows \(such as blank slips\) and delete them.
6. Go to the **Transcribers Notes** column and filter out all blank cells and check each comment, especially 'unsure' notes
7. Go to the **Additional Notes** column and filter out all blank cells and check each cell, making sure they are additional notes _from the flimsy_, and if not, transfer to transcribers notes column
8. Select the **Acquisition Date** field and right click to format all the cells according to 'Date' and then the long format: DD Month YYYY
9. Check consistency of **Acquisition Date** field, and that normalisation rules have been applied, and if not, correct them
10. Check and correct vulgar fractions \(1/2, 1/4, 3/4 are fine, all others need to be replaced, this includes fractions that have been spelled out and need to be re-typed as numbers\)
11. Find and correct and missing tagging of scored through text \(or other tagging such as \) by CTRL+F
12. Spot check classification and section abbreviations. If it appears there are a lot of mistakes then go through the available documents to check all fields in these columns are in the correct place.
13. Go through the R number column and separate out the different types by inserting the new R year number system into the respective column.
14. Select all of column A \(accession number\)
15. Go to **conditional formatting** then **highlight cells rules** then **duplicate values** and press 'OK' 
16. Check that duplicates are correctly entered and make sure sub-numbers are included to differentiate
17. Make sure transcribers name is standardised correctly with the e-mail address and _not_ the name.

## Step 3: Checking/correcting complete

1. Save the excel spreadsheet into the 'Checked Pre-Import' folder in Teams
2. Delete the old file in the 'completed spreadsheets' folder
3. Enter the date that you completed checking in the Transcribers Admin sheet in the 'Uploaded to Teams' column

## Step 4: Prepare Quickbase

## Step 5: Import spreadsheet to Quickbase
