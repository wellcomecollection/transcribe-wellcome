# Batch checking - Library Accession Registers

## Step 1: Prepare your batch for checking

1. The file will be saved under the location Documents -> General -> **Completed spreadsheets** in the Teams group
2. Select the file and download it to _your _local OneDrive. This is the file you will be working with to check - **not** the copy in the Teams folder.
3. Open the Transcribers Admin spreadsheet and locate this particular batch, enter the date in the **Returned Date** column and remove red fill from **In Progress **column
4. Open a notepad file and keep this available to you for note taking for any feedback that you think is appropriate as you go through the batch
5. Remember to visually check the batch throughout your checking process in case there's anything outside of these steps that may need to be fixed

## Step 2: Check and prepare the sheet for import

1. Unhide any hidden columns. If present, delete column D \[Volume URL] whether it is empty OR if it has links in it
2. Correct WAHMM references in column C to include a slash e.g. WA/HMM
3. Spot check that page image no. matches correct lh page for AccNo ranges
4. Go to the **Transcribers Notes** column and filter out all blank cells and check each comment, especially 'unsure' notes. Correct where possible
5. Select the **Date of Accession **field and right click to format all the cells according to 'Date' and then the long format: DD Month YYYY.
6. Check consistency of **Date of Accession** field, that a date has been entered in every row and that normalisation rules have been applied. If not, correct them
7. Ensure the **Author **column has been formatted correctly e.g. Surname, Forenames (Title)
8. Check and correct vulgar fractions (1/2, 1/4, 3/4 are fine, all others need to be replaced, this includes fractions that have been spelled out and need to be re-typed as numbers)
9. Check that multiple items in the **Price/Cost **column have been noted with square brackets and a note in the **Transcribers Notes **
10. Double check for any non-Latin script and ensure this is transliterated / marked in **Transcriber's Notes**
11. Make sure transcribers name is standardised correctly with the e-mail address and _not _the name
12. Check the bottom few rows of the sheet, in case additional rows have been added for out-of-place AccNos. If so, add any missing WA/HMM Box references for these rows, and highlight the rows in a different colour so that they stand out at the next stage
13. Make sure the assigned batch is transcribed and nothing less or more. If there is a discrepancy, make a note and follow up

## Step 3: Checking/correcting complete

1. Save the excel spreadsheet into the 'Checked Pre-Import' folder in Teams
2. Delete the old file in the 'completed spreadsheets' folder
3. Enter the date that you completed checking in the Transcribers Admin sheet in the **Uploaded to Teams** column
