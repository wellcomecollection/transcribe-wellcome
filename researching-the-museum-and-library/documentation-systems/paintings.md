## Later documentation of paintings

### 1935 to 1980

Between 1935 and 1980, paintings were registered in the museum's [new registration system](https://docs.wellcomecollection.org/transcribe-wellcome/researching-the-museum-and-library/documentation-systems/new-registration-system). Paintings were supposed to be given 'P' prefixes in place of 'R', although this doesn't appear to have been consistently applied. 

### 1981 to 2000

Paintings and prints were accessioned into the [library accession registers](https://docs.wellcomecollection.org/transcribe-wellcome/researching-the-museum-and-library/documentation-systems/library-accessions) from December 1981 to December 2000.
