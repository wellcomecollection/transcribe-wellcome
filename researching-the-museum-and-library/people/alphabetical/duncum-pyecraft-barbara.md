From Neil Adams and David Zuck obituary:  “Barbara's first work involved the classifying of items of folklore, amulets and various objects carried as mascots. Her job was to type the descriptions called out by Mr Lacaille, a model of patience and courtesy: 'There was a brief embarrassment when we came to mascots carried in the pockets of French soldiers during World War 1. "You must excuse it, Miss Pycraft", Lacaille called "a piss-pot, gunmetal; and another". Indeed, there were many scores of them; and although many soldiers must surely have been carrying other kinds of talismans l no longer remember what they were.'
Next, she worked on the history of cinchona, for which she had to learn a modicum of Spanish. and from this she passed to descriptions of native medical procedures. At times she was assisted by someone, returning from field expeditions, whose mother tongue was Spanish, 'an engaging character, small and leathery, with eyes so dark they could justifiably be called black,' who, it was said, had been recruited personally by Wellcome from the Peruvian army. In 1934 Barbara accompanied a senior member of staff, Alec Haggis, on a tour of churches in East Anglia and Devon, listing and photographing statues, carvings, and paintings of saints with medical connections. Then in 1936 she was asked to organise and run a journal-abstracting service covering the main fields of interest to the Museum. Within a short time she found that she was being swamped with data, little of which was of interest to her colleagues, and began to feel the need for a change of direction.”
