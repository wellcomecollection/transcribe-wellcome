Mr Keighley  (DATES)
Registrar

active: [recorded active c.1932- 
set up and oversaw system of registration 

!! Oral history
from oral history of Margaret Rowbottom. Discussing registration department work, inc after HSW’s death:

<<<
“A Registration department was set up under Mr Keighley, and a new system of registration inaugurated. The intention was that an object should only be ‘registered’ when it had been properly identified and scientifically described, but unfortunately Captain Saint, possibly under pressure from the Trustees [after HSW’s death] to produce results, had a lot of material renumbered with no correction of the information given on the accession cards or in the old registers.”

//Further research needed://
[dates for when new system was set up can be XR from WAHMM/CM files, where it is discussed. New reg numbers start from c.1929?]
