Quotes from oral history:

<<<

Whenever we borrowed a bronze surgical instrument he (HSW) would ask us to make a replica of it before we returned it. We usually did this in wood, and would then paint it with thin glue and dip it into a barrel of Verdigris. Providing it was not knocked about it would last quite a long time in the showcase.
