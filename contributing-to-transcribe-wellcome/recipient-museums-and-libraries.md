# Recipient Museums & Libraries

As part of Transcribe Wellcome, we are building a prototype demonstration for a virtual reunification of the 'Wellcome diaspora' - items loaned or gifted to other museums and libraries worldwide between Henry Wellcome's death in 1936 and 1982. 

If you are a curator or researcher with an interest in former Wellcome material at another museum or library, we'd love to hear from you! Please get in touch at [transcribe@wellcome.org](mailto:%20transcribe@wellcome.org).
