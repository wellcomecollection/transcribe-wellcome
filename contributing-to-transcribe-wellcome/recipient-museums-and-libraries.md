# Recipient Museums & Libraries

As part of Transcribe Wellcome, we are building a prototype demonstration for a virtual reunification of the 'Wellcome diaspora' - items loaned or gifted to other museums and libraries worldwide between Henry Wellcome's death in 1936 and 1982. 

If you are a curator or researcher with an interest in former Wellcome material at another museum or library, we'd love to hear from you! Please get in touch at [transcribe@wellcome.org](mailto:%20transcribe@wellcome.org).

We're particularly interested to hear more about:

* Holdings of former Wellcome collections: lists of your object numbers with brief descriptions, and if possible, URLs for individual objects. Even single examples are helpful - every little counts!
* Concordance data: however messy, connecting your object numbers to WHMM accession and/or registration identifiers. We're happy to help with data cleanup and standardisation.
* Any Wellcome documentation in your possession as we try to understand more about the gaps in the archive we still hold: index cards, copies of registers, sales catalogues, object files, correspondence relating to the dispersal to your library or museum, etc.
* Current lines of provenance research about specific objects, geographies or themes.
