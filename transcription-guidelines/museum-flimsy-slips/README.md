### The Transcription Spreadsheet

The column headings in the transcription spreadsheet correspond – broadly – to the headings printed on the flimsy slips, plus some additional columns for recording details which may be useful for future data analysis and online search.

The style of the printed flimsy slips changed over time, and according to the purpose for which they were used by Wellcome Historical Medical Museum, and some headings were rarely used.

### General transcription instructions

Generally, each flimsy slip will be transcribed onto **one** row of the spreadsheet, except:

* When one slip has more than one object described in detail, in which case split the description over separate rows, with one row for each object. Give each row/description a **sub number** in **column E** \[1, 2, 3, 4 etc.\] or an alphabetical identifier if letters of the alphabet have been used to distinguish items on the flimsy slip itself \(this is rare, but there are some known examples\).
* When one slip represents a short running sequence of A numbers, in which case use a separate row for each number in the sequence, transcribing the details from the card onto each row. Note that you will not be able to copy and paste an entire row of the spreadsheet \(which should prevent you accidentally duplicating rows for the same A number\), but you can copy and paste column D across to column V if the details are the same as the preceding row.
* Some flimsy slips will have **pencil** written in addition to pen. If you see this, please transcribe as per usual in their respective fields i.e if half the description is in pen and the other in pencil, transcriber all of it in the description \(column K\).
  * If it is unclear where the pencil writing is meant to go, please enter it into additional notes \(column Q\) and highlight this in the transcribers note column.
* If there is an original **question mark** within a field and/or writing on your flimsy slip, please transcribe this exactly as it shows and make a note that it is in the original flimsy slip in the transcribers notes column.
* If there is something you are unsure of, please note it as \[…\] and make sure there is an **‘unsure’** note in the transcribers column, describing what it is you are unsure of.

**Important note:** For any text which has been scored through, do the same in the transcription. If you do use the strikethrough, or any other formatted text, you **must** use the appropriate tagging e.g. &lt;s&gt;\[transcribed text here\]&lt;/s&gt; or &lt;i&gt;\[_transcribed text here_\]&lt;/i&gt; for italics.

**Important note:** You may notice gaps in the accession numbers, this is normal. Please continue to work with the numbers assigned in column A.

**Important note:** You may see the following image has a **sketching** of the object, this is the reverse of the flimsy slip that has been digitised. Please make a note of this sketching in the transcribers notes column.

**Definitions for general reference:**

* **Acquisition date –** When the item/object/record was _acquired_ e.g. the date it was bought at an auction
* **Accession date –** When the item/object/record was accessioned _into_ the collection

### Green Column Headings

A number \(column A\)**:** For each flimsy slip, transcribe the ‘Accessions No.’ \(A number\) for the accession\(s\) described on the slip on a new row of the transcription spreadsheet. This number is usually written in the top left hand corner of the flimsy slip.

This A number is a number of up to 6 digits in length, sometimes written on the flimsy slip with an ‘A’ prefix or suffix, but more often without. Only transcribe the number, without prefix or suffix. If a comma is used in the number \(123,456\), do not include it in the transcription.

Other identifying numbers may also be written on the flimsy slip: the ‘A’ number will always be the top or first number, even if it is not at the top left hand corner of the slip.

**Important note:** If you come across an A number for which you have a duplicate \(or slightly variant 2nd\) card, or a number which is outside your allocated sequence, please transcribe these at the bottom of your spreadsheet, adding the relevant A number into column A.

Columns B and C have been hidden and locked. They will be filled in after the full box is completely transcribed:

**WA/HMM Box \(column B\):** Wellcome reference for the boxes of flimsy slips. This column has been hidden and will be completed later. Please ignore this column.

**Box URL \(column C\):** This column has been hidden and its contents deleted, please ignore it.

Image no. \(column D\)**:** For each flimsy slip, enter the [image number]() given in the Wellcome Library website Viewer toolbar. If you are transcribing from a PDF, the image number is the page number minus 1.

Sub number \(column E\)**:** this column is only required where more than one row is required for a flimsy slip, or where there are several cards representing one A number, as explained in the [general transcription instructions](). Leave blank in all other cases.

R number \(column F\)**:** Registration \(‘R’\) numbers are sometimes written under or to the right hand side of A numbers. They can also appear in the middle of the flimsy slip. Similarly to the A number, they may appear with an R prefix but more commonly without.

R numbers can take one of two forms:

* An R running number \(e.g. 12345\) – note that written without a prefix, this style of R number is easily confused with an A number, but will always be the bottom or second number written on the slip.
* An R-date number \(e.g. 4168/1937\). This example means that the object was the 4168 object registered in 1937. In some cases the R-date number can appear elsewhere on the slip, such as within a stamp. You may also see the R-date number written in reverse \(e.g. 1937/4168\), with an abbreviated year form \(e.g. 4168/37\), and with commas or apostrophes used in place of / \(e.g. 4168’37\). Please transcribe all R-date forms in full with the year last i.e. R4168/1937. You can assume all the years referenced by R-date number are in the twentieth century, i.e. 19xx.

When transcribing in this column, please always add the prefix ‘R’ before the number.

**Important note:** You will occasionally encounter flimsy slips which record an A number, an R running number _and_ an R-date number for the same object. In this case, please record both references, separated by a semi-colon and space, e.g. R1234; R56/1951.

**Important note:** You will also come across a _range_ of R numbers for multiple items on one flimsy slip. Please make sure to enter each one within the range. E.g if you see R45826-7 then fully list them R45826; R45827… etc. separated by a semi-colon.

Classification \(column G\)**:** Enter the classification as it appears on the slip. E.g., QQ, CCC, M etc. or leave blank as appropriate.

Group \(column H\)**:** Enter any text that appears in the ‘Group’ section of the slip. In almost all cases though, this field is blank.

The **Section** header on the slips often contains an abbreviation representing either or both the type of object and its place of origin \(culture\):

Section \[T\] \(column I\)**:** Transcribe the type of the object in column I. These take the form of an abbreviation: VES \(Vessel\), COS \(Costume\), AW \(Arrows\), AM \(Amulet\) etc. In some cases, there will be more than one type, which should be separated by a semi-colon in your transcription. Please note that the abbreviations used may represent insensitive or outdated terminology which you may find uncomfortable. Please transcribe the abbreviation as written on the flimsy slip.

Section \[C\] \(column J\)**:** Transcribe any place of origin \(culture\) abbreviation in column J, exactly as written on the flimsy slip. Examples include, but are not limited to Egy \(Egypt\), Afri \(Africa\), Jap \(Japan\), Ind \(Indian\), Per \(Peru\), New \(New Guinea\), Gk \(Greek\), Rmn \(Roman\), Moor \(Moorish\), Ma \(Maori\), Chin \(China\), Bur \(Burmese\), Tib \(Tibetan\), Turk \(Turkish\), Mex \(Mexican\), Esk \(Eskimo\).

Description of object \(column K\)**:** Enter the description of the object\(s\) in this column, exactly as written on the flimsy slip, _except_ when the slip describes multiple objects which can be clearly separated out onto separate rows, please use separate rows for each object and remember to add **sub numbers** in **Column E**.

If a slip uses ‘ditto’ or ‘do’ in the description, replace ‘ditto’ with the description from the object above. e.g. the 2nd row for the flimsy slip describing ‘Red pottery vase 12th Dynasty. 10" high. 4" diameter. Ditto 11" high. 3" diameter’ would read ‘Red pottery vase 12th Dynasty. 11” high. 3” diameter’.

Transcribe fractions \(e.g. in measurements\) using Insert – Symbol and selecting the correct proper fraction. If you encounter difficulties in finding the correct symbol, record this in the **transcriber’s notes \(column V\)**.

The following are keyboard shortcuts that can be used instead of the insert method:

**Alt + 0188 = ¼** **Alt + 0189 = ½** **Alt + 0190 = ¾**

All other fractions need to be written out as e.g. 5/8, remembering to put a space beforehand, i.e. 3 5/8" because the symbols available in Excel aren't widely interpreted outside of Microsoft word \(so get replaced by squiggles when we import the spreadsheets into Quickbase\).

Note that after the description, some slips include the lot numbers or value. Instead of including them in this field, they should be recorded in **Columns L** and **M**. Sometimes the description continues on the back of the slip. Use proper fractions \(symbols\) for the measurements.

**Important note:** If you come across non-pound sterling currencies, simply transcribe other currencies as they are written e.g. 36l.

Bought of \(column L\)**:** Transcribe the acquisition details, which usually appear in the slip under ‘bought of’, exactly as written on the flimsy slip.

Value \(column M\)**:** Enter the acquisition value of the object in this column, exactly as written on the flimsy slip. When a slip describes multiple items, these are often recorded after each object and should be entered one per row for each object as explained in the [general transcription instructions]().

At present \(column N\)**:** Anything recorded in the ‘at present’ field should be transcribed here, exactly as written on the flimsy slip. This may refer to objects transferred to the Wellcome Research Institute, or dispersed to other museums. For example, ‘To WRI 18 X 37’ means that the object was transferred to the Wellcome Research Institute on the 18 Oct 1937. In most cases, this heading will be empty on the slips and blank on the transcription.

Case No. \(column O\)**:** Enter the case number here. Sometimes more than one will be recorded; separate different case numbers with a semi-colon. Others may be scored through and replaced with a new one. In this case, show the old number scored through in this column.

To be placed \(column P\)**:** Transcribe any text or letters under the ‘To be placed’ heading, exactly as written on the flimsy slip. In most cases, this heading will be empty on the slips and blank on the transcription.

Additional notes on flimsy \(column Q\): Use this column to enter, exactly as written, any additional notes on the flimsy slip not previously transcribed.

**Stamp structure** If you see a stamp on your flimsy slip, enter this information in this column according to the following format: \[Stamp\] W.H.M.M. ACCESSION DEPARTMENT. Received DD Month Year. Acc no.\#\#\# -&gt;

If there is _both_ a stamp and additional notes, please put all the additional notes **first** and then the stamp transcription.

**Important note:** If you notice anything is written in non-Latin script and you cannot discern or transliterate it, please put \[…\]. Please make a note that you have come across non-latin script in column V’s ‘Transcriber’s notes.’

**Important note:** If there is anything you cannot read and posting about it in Microsoft Teams does not help either, please put \[?\] in the place of a single letter or entire word and make sure to make note of this in column V’s ‘Transcriber notes’

### Blue Column Headings

In addition to transcribing text exactly as written on the flimsy slips under the green column headings, transcribers should also extract acquisition date and \(where relevant\) auction house and lot numbers into a standardised format:

Acquisition Date \(column R\):

Transcribe acquisition dates according to the following instructions:

* Enter an exact acquisition date where this is written on the flimsy slip \(usually already transcribed in **Bought of \(column L\)**\) in the format DD-Month-Full Year. e.g. 22 January 1929. Or…
* Where the date written on the flimsy slip is given **only as a month**, **year**, or **span of days**, enter the latest date at which the object\(s\) can have been acquired by the Wellcome Historical Medical Museum. Examples are as follows:
  * A written acquisition date of August 1952 should be entered as 31 August 1952;
  * A written acquisition date of 1924 should be entered as 31 December 1924;
  * A sale held on **17-20 January 1930** should be entered as **20 January 1930**.
* For dates in February, you may find [this list of leap years 1800 - 2400](https://kalender-365.de/leap-years.php) useful. Or…
* Enter the date at which the item is known to have been processed by the W.H.M.M. Accessions Department, if - and only if - no other date is written on the card. Or…
* Leave the field **blank** where **no date at all is written** on the flimsy slip **unless** the date of acquisition can be reasonably assumed from other contextual evidence \(e.g. adjacent flimsy slips recording objects acquired from the same source\).

All assumptions and normalisations should be **noted in the Transcriber's Notes**.

Auction House \(column S\): In many cases, the acquisition will be an auction purchase - e.g. Soth. 6 & 7/12/20 Lot 196 refers to lot 196 sold at Sotheby’s during the sale held on 6th and 7th December 1920. Sometimes the lot number appears before the date, and the month may appear in Roman numerals \(Soth. 91/1/XII/30\).

These abbreviations can expanded using the list below. Select the relevant auction house from the dropdown list in column R.

Ch. = Christies

Deb. = Debenham Stores

Fos. = Foster

Glen. = Glendining

H. = Hurcome

K.F.&R. = Knight, Frank & Rutley

R.F.&H. = Robinson, Fisher & Harding

P.&S. = Puttick & Simpson

P.S.&N. = Phillips Son & Neale

Soth. = Sotheby’s

St. = Stevens

Lot No. \(column T\): Enter the lot number, if applicable, in this column. When a slip describes multiple items, these are often recorded next to each object \(when different lot numbers\) and should be entered on separate rows as explained in the [general transcription instructions]().

### Yellow Column Headings

Transcribed By \(column U\): Your email address ****e.g. j.bloggs@wellcome.org.

Transcriber’s Notes \(column V\): Use this column to record any additional notes. For example, if the slip is accompanied by a letter or extensive notes not transcribed in ‘Description of object’, there is a drawing, the slip is double sided etc.

**Important note:** Also use this column to note any problems you have had with the transcription. Prefix this note with ‘Unsure’ followed by an explanation e.g. ‘Unsure: cannot read last digit of accession number’.

**Important note:** If you have made a remark that relates to more than one accession, please make sure you add it into every relevant **Transcriber’s Notes** column. In the future, each row may be displayed individually without the context of the rows above and below it. For the same reason, do not use the phrases ‘see above’ or ‘see below’ in any column.

Creative Commons Licence \(Column W\): This column assigns the CC0 terms to each row of transcribed data and does not require transcription. 

### Upon completion
