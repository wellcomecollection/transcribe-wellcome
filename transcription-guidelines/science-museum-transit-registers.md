# Science Museum Transit Registers

## The Transcription Spreadsheet

The column headings in the transcription spreadsheet correspond - broadly - to the headings used in the transit register, plus some additional columns linking your transcription to the digitised archive record \(and for notes\). 

As working documents, the transit registers are heavily customised and annotated, and columns may sometimes appear in the registers in a different layout to that set out in the transcription template. 

## General Transcription Instructions

Each row of the transit register should be transcribed onto one row of the spreadsheet.

Wellcome object identifiers are inconsistently recorded in the transit registers. When transcribing these identifiers, please transcribe _without_ prefix i.e. `R1234` should be transcribed into the **Old R number** column as just `1234`. 

## Green Column Headings

### **A number** 

Transcribe the accession \('A number'\) for each object from the left hand column of the transit register \(headed 'No.' in the register\) onto a new row in the spreadsheet:

A numbers are integers of up to 6 digits in length. 

Do not include the A prefix, even if this is written in the transit register. 

### Object Description

Transcribe the object description from the column headed 'object description' in the transit register. But do not include any registration numbers written into this column in the register.

### Old R number

Transcribe the 'old registration number' for the object, without prefix.

Old registration numbers are integers of up to 5 digits in length. 

Do not include the R prefix on the spreadsheet, even if this is written in the transit register.  i.e. `R1234` in the register should be transcribed as `1234` in this column in the spreadsheet.

### New R number

Transcribe the 'new registration number' for the object, without prefix.

New registration numbers consist of 4 parts:

* a prefix \(which is always `R` in the transit registers\)
* an integer of up to 5 digits in length
* a divider \(usually written as `/` in the transit registers\)
* a year \(usually written in full, and should always be transcribed as a full 4 digits\)

Here are some examples of new registration numbers written in full:

```text
R1234/1938
R6/1964
R14057/1936

```

For the purposes of transit register transcription, these should be transcribed _without_ prefix i.e. `1234/1938`. 

### Box Number

Transcribe the box or case number exactly as written in the transit register. This is not a printed heading but has been added as an additional column on most pages of the registers.
