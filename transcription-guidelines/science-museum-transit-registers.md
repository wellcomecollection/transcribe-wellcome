# Science Museum Transit Registers

## The Transcription Spreadsheet

The column headings in the transcription spreadsheet correspond - broadly - to the headings used in the transit register, plus some additional columns linking your transcription to the digitised archive record \(and for notes\). 

As working documents, the transit registers are heavily customised and annotated, and columns may sometimes appear in the registers in a different layout to that set out in the transcription template. 

## General Transcription Instructions

Generally, each row of the transit register should be transcribed onto one row of the spreadsheet.

Wellcome object identifiers are inconsistently recorded in the transit registers. When transcribing these identifiers, please transcribe _without_ prefix i.e. `R1234` should be transcribed into the 'Old R number' column as just `1234`.
