# Using Grp_Wellcome_Transcribers on Teams

As part of the Transcribe Wellcome team you will be invited to join the Transcribers' group on Microsoft Teams. The group is an important part of the transcription process and is the best way to keep up to date with updates, advice and events.

There are several channels within the group:

* **General:** Where the organisation team/admin post important updates and event announcements. The ‘Files’ section on this channel is where members upload spreadsheets when they want feedback or once they have completed their transcriptions. 

* **Library Accession Cards:** A channel where members can ask for and read advice in transcribing the Library Accession Registers. Members should also use this space to highlight any interesting finds from the Registers and inform the admin team when they have submitted completed Library spreadsheets.

* **Museum Index Cards:** A channel for members to ask for and read advice in transcribing the Museum Flimsy Slips. Members should also use this space to highlight any interesting finds from the Slips and inform the admin team when they have submitted completed Museum spreadsheets.

* **Visual Material Registers:** A channel where members can ask for and read advice in transcribing the Visual Material Registers. Members should also use this space to highlight any interesting finds from the Registers and inform the admin team when they have submitted completed Visual Material spreadsheets. 

* **Transcribers:** A chat channel for members to introduce themselves and ask for Library or Museum spreadsheets.

* **FAQ:** A channel answering frequently asked questions on all aspects of the transcription work.

* **Transcribe Wellcome [TW]:** A channel for updates, questions and requests regarding the Transcribe Wellcome database.
