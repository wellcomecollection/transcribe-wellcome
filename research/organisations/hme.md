# Historical Medical Exhibition

Historical Medical Exhibition \(HME\)

Temporary exhibition of medical history, for which planning began in 1903 as a promotional exhibition to coincide with [Burroughs Wellcome & Company](bw.md)'s 25th anniversary in 1905. However the scale of collecting and loans rapidly expanded and the exhibition finally opened in 1913 for the 17th International Congress of Medicine.

The exhibition closed shortly afterwards, but reopened as the permanent [Wellcome Historical Medical Museum \(WHMM\)](whmm.md) in May 1914.
