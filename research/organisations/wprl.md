# Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories

Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories \(WPRL\)

Established c.1899 as a laboratory under the directorship of Dr Walter Dowson. Theoretically independent of [Burroughs Wellcome & Company](research/organisations/bw.md) but in practice administered through their head office and carried out some work on company products.

Located at Beckenham, London from 1922.

Symons 1993 says foundation of WPRL was often given as 1894 during Henry Wellcome's lifetime but that is not accurate.
