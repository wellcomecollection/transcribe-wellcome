Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories (WPRL)

Established c.1899 as a laboratory under the directorship of Dr Walter Dowson. Theoretically independent of [Burroughs Wellcome & Company](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/transcribe-wellcome/tree/0f24dd579552fbec9fe9ff9419c2bdd0a7b7925c/research/organisations/research/organisations/bw.md) but in practice administered through their head office and carried out some work on company products.

Located at Beckenham, London from 1922.

[Symons 1993](https://archive.org/details/Symons1993/mode/2up) says foundation of WPRL was often given as 1894 during Henry Wellcome's lifetime (e.g. [in this 1934 exhibition booklet about the WRI](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/e5ahc5zu/items?canvas=17)) but that is not accurate.
