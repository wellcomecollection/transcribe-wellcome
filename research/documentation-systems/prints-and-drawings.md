# Prints and Drawings

## Prints and Photographs accessioned before 1918

Some prints and photographs were accessioned, probably by the library rather than museum, before 1918, in a sequence P1 to P1874: WA/HMM/IC/1/4.

Not to be confused with paintings registered in the museum [\(old\) registration system](https://docs.wellcomecollection.org/transcribe-wellcome/researching-the-museum-and-library/documentation-systems/old-registration-system) with a P prefix.

## PD and PD Year Numbers

Batch accessioning of prints and drawings, some retrospective, begun by C. A. Earnshaw in February 1936 and continued by others up to 1982. Initially sequential; later reverts to 1-1 each new year.

Registers: PD 1 to PD 391 \(WA/HMM/IC/1/28-31\); Gap 1938 to 1959; PD 1959-1-1 to PD 1982-14 \(WA/HMM/IC/1/32\)

## PR Numbers

Prints, mostly portraits; series constructed by Pender-Davidson between 1928 and 1933.

Registers PR 1 to PR 1104 \(WA/HMM/IC/1/7\). Later registers are missing but provenance details for PR1 to PR26508 were reconstructed by Earnshaw \(with some gaps\) in a report in WA/HMM/RP/Sta/3.

## Later documentation of prints

### 1981 to 2000

Paintings and prints were accessioned into the [library accession registers](https://docs.wellcomecollection.org/transcribe-wellcome/researching-the-museum-and-library/documentation-systems/library-accessions) from December 1981 to December 2000.
