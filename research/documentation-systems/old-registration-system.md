# Old Registration System

Wellcome Historical Medical Museum \[WHMM\] began formally registering objects in December 1913, according to a simple sequence of numbers running continuously from R1 to R60514 \(dated May 1933\).

Registration details were handwritten into bound ledger volumes, and the assigned number painted on the objects in black or white ink \(WA/HMM/CM/Acc/1-20\). There were also index cards for selected R numbered objects \(WA/HMM/CM/Inv/A.232-A.239\).

Paintings were also registered in the museum registers between 1914 and 1933, sometimes \(but not always\) with the prefix 'P' substituted for 'R'.

No registration of objects appears to have taken place between 1933 and 1935.
