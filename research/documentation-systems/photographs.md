# Photographs

PHO series begun by Pender-Davidson in December 1928. Continuous sequence to 1987. Negative numbers noted usually refer to Wellcome Images M sequence.

Registers PHO 1 to PHO 15277 \(WA/HMM/IC/1/9-24\)

Index cards PHO 1 to PHO 2234 \(WA/HMM/IC/3/C.1-C.14\)

Pre-1918, a few photographs were accessioned, probably by the library rather than the museum, and given P references \(see [section on Prints and Drawings](https://docs.wellcomecollection.org/transcribe-wellcome/researching-the-museum-and-library/documentation-systems/prints-and-drawings)\)
