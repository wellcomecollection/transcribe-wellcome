# Auction Houses

[Notes on auction catalogue annotation](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h2byq8za/items?canvas=299), early-mid 1920s \(in [WA/HMM/CO/Sub/204](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h2byq8za)\)

It was not uncommon for [more than one buyer to attend a single sale](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h2byq8za/items?canvas=343). Each buyer was asked to mark up a copy of the catalogue with the '[purchaser of every item, together with the price paid, including other lots purchased by our own people](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/h2byq8za/items?canvas=365)'.
