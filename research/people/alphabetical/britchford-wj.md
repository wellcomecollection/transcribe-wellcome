# Britchford, W.J.

W.J. Britchford. Chief Carpenter. Life dates: 1926-1968 Active: 1926-1968

## work at WHMM

Begun work in 1926, during time of museum reorganisation at Wigmore Street. Oversaw other joiners working at the museum. Worked on making showcases/cabinets, and producing replica objects for display in museum.

Quote from oral history, Symons 1987, 28:

> Whenever we borrowed a bronze surgical instrument he \(HSW\) would ask us to make a replica of it before we returned it. We usually did this in wood, and would then paint it with thin glue and dip it into a barrel of Verdigris. Providing it was not knocked about it would last quite a long time in the showcase.
