&lt;&lt;&lt; The ethnographical category was by far the largest, and it was this material that [Miss Burstein ](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/transcribe-wellcome/tree/f72c2b61ac1ad669053741de27081d2c70951534/researching-the-museum-and-library/people/alphabetical/Burstein,%20Rosa/README.md)and I sorted into appropriate sub-categories for re-packing – the whole of the first floor South Gallery was devoted to this purpose. Later when we had caught up with the arrears of sorting, we were also put onto accessioning. From interest and in order that I might work on more or less equal terms with the other members of the ethnographical staff, I added anthropology to my General Degree. &lt;&lt;&lt;

discussing ethnographic collections \[//contains derogatory historic language describing African cultures//\]

&lt;&lt;&lt; \[In 1934\] I remember being present at a meeting of the ethnographical staff with Sir Henry and Captain Saint at which plans were made to go through Sir Henry’s very large collection of weapons, including Oriental and European as well as primitive. By degrees literally thousands of weapons were accessioned and arranged in racks according to types and country of origin. I can remember seeing Sir Henry happily prowling around the racks, often with [Mr Keighley](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/transcribe-wellcome/tree/f72c2b61ac1ad669053741de27081d2c70951534/researching-the-museum-and-library/people/alphabetical/Keighley,%20Mr/README.md), the Registrar. &lt;&lt;&lt;
