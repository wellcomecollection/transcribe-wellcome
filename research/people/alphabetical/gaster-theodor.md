!! Oral history

&lt;&lt;&lt; I remember the constant thrill of recovering some of the most precious antiquities from the Ancient Near East which Wellcome had purchased years ago and which no one had heard of since. They had been packed away in boxes at Willesden and elsewhere and were gradually being unpacked. There was the missing part of the Cesnula Cypriotic collection, most of which went to the Met. Museum in New York; there was also a large portion of the Petrie collection of Egyptian amulets and scarabs, most of which went to university college.; one day I found in an old cigar box some very charred bits of papyrus which were the fragments of the famous ‘Astarte myth’ from the Amherst Collection \(subsequently sold to the Morgan Library\). Some of the best stuff got sold by auction after the Old Man died. &lt;&lt;&lt;
