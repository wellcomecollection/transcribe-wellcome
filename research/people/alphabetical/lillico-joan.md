# Lillico, Joan

Joan Wilson Lillico.  Folklorist and anthropologist.  Life dates: 12 March 1911 - ?

### Work at WHMM

Employed from 1935 as an assistant in the museum’s ‘Ethnographic Section’. Working under Rosa Burstein, she catalogued anthropology collections as part of the large-scale re-registration of objects. From handwriting samples in accession registers, Lillico registered objects from Nigeria collected by the anthropologist M.D.W. Jeffreys. In the late 1930s she worked on object displays for the ethnographic gallery at Euston Road.

Oral history in Symons 1987. Includes discussing work on the ethnographic collections in the 1930s, pp 31-32:

> We worked in an enormous gallery divided into compartments by screens and empty packing cases and spent most of our time identifying and cataloguing the thousands of objects bought in Sale Rooms. We were helped with the heavy work of lifting, opening cases etc. by two men, [Webb](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/transcribe-wellcome/tree/f72c2b61ac1ad669053741de27081d2c70951534/researching-the-museum-and-library/people/alphabetical/Webb,%20Mr/README.md) & [Stow](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/transcribe-wellcome/tree/f72c2b61ac1ad669053741de27081d2c70951534/researching-the-museum-and-library/people/alphabetical/Stow,%20Harry/README.md). … I gather he and Webb between them did a lot of the bidding at sales when Sir Henry was building up the ethnographic collection.
