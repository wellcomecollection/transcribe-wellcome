## Work at WHMM

Object selection for purchase: viewing items day before auction sales and marking up catalogues with items of interest. Identifying and registering items arriving after auction sale purchase. Worked mostly at the museum premises Wigmore Street or at warehouse for stored objects (Oxford St Marylebone Lane at Oxford St end), occasionally too at Willesden stores. Selected objects for display, arranged and interpreted them. (“There had been talk in the early days of our taking our PhDs, but as it turned out we had no facilities for this and no contact or access to the library at Willesden.” – oral history p11.).

## Oral history

> Overshadowing the years in Wigmore Street was the registration of the vast Pareyn collection of ethnographic material from the Belgian Congo – hundreds of carved wooden effigies, thousands of spears, knives, shields, headdresses and so forth. There was a time when we, in the ethnographical department, could tell at a glance which river and tribe each item came from.

* Symons 1987, p12-13.
