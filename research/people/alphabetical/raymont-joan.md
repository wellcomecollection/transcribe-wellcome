Quotes from oral history:

&lt;&lt;&lt;

Soon after our arrival in Wigmore Street, we, the ‘scientific’ staff were supplied with stiff heavy khaki overalls of the kind worn by warehousemen and furniture removers, and dispatched to a disused factory or warehouse at Willesden. The employment situation was such that no one dared complain. Independence meant everything to me. But we had all taken the job on the understanding that we were to work at Wigmore Street, and had made arrangements accordingly. For me the journey was a long and tedious one by bus up the Harrow Road. … The factory…lay between a tannery and an anchovy essence factory, and there were appalling smells \(especially on Fridays\). .. The premises where we had to work were practically unheated, and the winter of 1928-9 was a particularly cold one; all of us were more or less ill. …At Willesden, we took our orders from Mr. Port and Miss Jones. … These two had over the years evolved at system and a language of their own. ‘Curious object, use unknown’, we were often advised to write or ‘It has been good’. Otherwise it was ‘shelve it’ – when all else failed.

Sir Henry was at that time buying through his agents anything and everything, almost regardless of its connection with the history of medicine – coaches, carriages, perambulators, African spears, skeletons, porcelain, Japanese netsukes, all arrived almost daily in huge consignments. As our ignorance of much of this material was almost total, the cataloguing was largely guess-work.
