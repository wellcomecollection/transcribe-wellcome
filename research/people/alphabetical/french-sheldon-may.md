# French-Sheldon, May

Mrs French Sheldon American, former medical missionary in Congo. Was present at WHMM at Wigmore Street but unclear what she did as a member of staff.

Reference in obituary of [duncum-pyecraft-barbara.md](duncum-pyecraft-barbara.md "mention"), which quotes from John Symons 1987 (even though it says 1982 in the obit?).
