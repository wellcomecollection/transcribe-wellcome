# Moore-Guggisberg, Lillian Decima

Lady Lillian Decima Moore-Guggisberg (11 December 1871-18 February 1964) was an English actress and singer, who, after a successful career on stage, married Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg in 1905. Brigadier-general Guggisberg was appointed Governor of the Gold Coast (Ghana) in 1919. As wife of the Governor, Lady Moore-Guggisberg was named the Honorary Exhibition Commissioner for the Gold Coast at the British Empire Exhibition. In 1925 Lady Decima Moore-Guggisberg transferred to Sir Henry Wellcome a permanent loan of a collection of objects from the Gold Coast pavilion from the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley. As the objects were considered a loan rather than a gift, the Wellcome Trust, as early as 1943, sought the permission of Lady Moore-Guggisberg to disperse the remaining objects from her loan. A portion of the loan had already been destroyed in air raids in 1941.
