# Iles, Isaac

Proprietor of The Queen's Head in Bristol that maintained a collection of objects. &#x20;

&#x20;In 1925, Charles J. S. Thompson exchanged letters with and acquired several objects from a “Mr. Iles” in Bristol. Iles recounted to Thompson that the posts in his collection were “brought home by a soldier from South Nigeria after an expedition.” (Thompson, April 15, 1925).  Upon arrival in Bristol, Thompson remarked on the objects which were "laid out like a museum" and in beautiful condition. Iles further explained that he had traveled to Nigeria and Congo himself bringing back many objects. Isaac’s father had started the collection by weapons from sailors coming off the ships. (Thompson, May 4, 1925).  &#x20;

Thompson’s correspondence gives Iles’s address as “broad plain”-- a 1914 registry of Bristol businesses then provides Iles’s first name. (Kelly’s Directory, 884)&#x20;
