# William Hewlett

William Hewlett was born on 22/07/1898 at 77 Elder Street in the district of St Peter in Brighton to William Henry Hewlett and Minnie Emma Hewlett (nee Wells). William Henry Hewlett worked as a coach painter at a railway factory.

In 1931 William Hewlett was living at 15 Western Road, East Finchley (now in the London Borough of Haringey). He lived with Annie Letitia Hewlett (born 19/03/1901) and Arthur Victor Hewlett (born 27/04/1901, also in Brighton) who is likely William’s brother.

In 1939 they are still living together. William is working as a musician (instrumentalist) and Arthur is a L/Sgt in the Coldstream Guards. The 1921 census indicates that Arthur had been in the army since at least then.

Thus, William Hewlett’s connection to the Benin expedition of 1897 and the looted objects remains unclear. Arthur’s long term military service could suggest a family military connection, but William Henry Hewlett was working in a factory the year after the expedition so was unlikely to have been involved.
