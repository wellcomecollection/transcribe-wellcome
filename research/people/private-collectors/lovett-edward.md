# Lovett, Edward

Edward Lovett (1852 – 1933) was born in Islington, United Kingdom. He worked as the chief cashier at the London branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.  He spent his spare time researching and collecting charms, amulets (thousands), dolls (500) and toys, in the neighborhoods of London and vicinities. After his retirement, he dedicated his life to Alpine plants, rock gardens and small alpine specimens grown in seashells, which he distributed to his friends as protective amulets.&#x20;

He donated most of his collection to the Pitt-Rivers Museum.  In addition, he did substantial donations to the Cuming Museum, London, V\&A Museum of Childhood, the National Museum of Edinburgh.  The Wellcome Trust purchased Lovett’s collection of charms for 60 British pounds in January of 1917. &#x20;

In 2011, the Wellcome Collection organized an exhibition of Lovett’s collection of charms and amulets.  Felicity Powell, the artist, curated the exhibition and presented over 1400 charms and amulets, along with her artworks
