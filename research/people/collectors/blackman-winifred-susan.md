# Blackman, Winifred Susan

Winifred Susan Blackman (1872 - 1950) was retained by Captain Peter Johnston-Saint, third Conservator of the Wellcome Museum, to collect ethnographic materials relating to the _fellahin_ of Egypt.

&#x20;Winifred Susan Blackman was born in Westmorland, England in 1872. Her younger brother, Aylward Manley Blackman, an Egyptologist, was a fellow at Worcester College, and following him Winifred went to Oxford in 1912 where she started volunteering at the Pitt Rivers Museum. Following her father’s sudden death in 1913, Winifred appealed to Henry Balfour and Robert Marett for work. (Larson 116). Balfour secured some funds to employ her an assistant and she spent many years cataloging the collection. In 1915, Winifred secured her diploma in Anthropology from Oxford. She first traveled to Egypt with Aylward and a group of his students in 1920. She went again in 1921, this time without her brother. &#x20;

&#x20;During her many visits, subsidized by several small grants from Oxford University, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, and the Royal Society. From 1927-1932, Wellcome paid her 250 a year in exchange for objects related to the history of medicine (Egyptian charms, and remedies) (Larson 262-264) During her time in Egypt, Hideyb Abd el-Shafy and his wife Sadia housed and guided Winifred. Frances Larson writes “Over the years, Blackman became famous among the fellahin. To the Egyptians she was a contradiction in terms: an Englishwoman who traveled alone and lived with them as their guest. Unlike other English visitors, Winifred did not impose herself: she was there to listen, observe, and record what she saw...” (Larson 145-146)&#x20;

She documented the traditional and the contemporary customs of the fellahin, the farmers of Egypt. Material that she collected is now primarily at the Pitt Rivers Museum, the British Museum, and the Fowler Museum at UCLA, with smaller numbers of objects on loan to Sir Henry Wellcome's Museum Collection at the Science Museum and at the Egypt Centre Swansea.Material that she collected is now primarily at the Pitt Rivers Museum, the British Museum, and the Fowler Museum at UCLA, with smaller numbers of objects on loan to Sir Henry Wellcome's Museum Collection at the Science Museum and at the Egypt Centre Swansea.&#x20;
